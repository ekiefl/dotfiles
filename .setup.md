# New machine setup

## Install iTerm2

https://iterm2.com/

## Choose default shell

```
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

## Install package manager

I use brew:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Post installation might ask you to add some lines to your `.zprofile` like:

```
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

Don't bother, this is already taken care of in my yadm-managed dotfiles. Simply execute `eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"` (or equivalent) in your current shell session to gain access to the `brew` binary.

## Neovim

```bash
brew install neovim
```

Once we manage dotfiles with yadm, `vim` will be set as an alias for `nvim` binary. Until then, just use `nvim`.

## Install yadm

```
brew install yadm
```

Pull:

```
yadm pull
```

If there are conflicts, resolve them. Expect errors (but yay if not)

## Conda

This silently installs without modifying any shell setup scripts (bashrc, etc)

```
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda.sh
bash ~/miniconda.sh -b -p $HOME/miniconda
```

Re-source and verify with `conda`

## Nerd font

```
brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
brew install --cask font-hack-nerd-font
```

In iTerm2, go to preferences, profile, text, and change the font to Hack Nerd Font.
